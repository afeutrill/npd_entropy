# NPD-Entropy

An implementation of a non-parametric differentail entropy rate estimator, developed by Andrew Feutrill and Matthew Roughan. This estimation technique quantises data from a continuous-valued process, then utilises Shannon entropy rate estimators for a differential entropy rate estimate.
